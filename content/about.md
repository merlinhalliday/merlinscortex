On this site you will find a mixture of my personal projects and academic research, along with anything else that interests me. It also serves as my professional profile, so feel free to check out my [CV]("/resume") or connect on [LinkedIn](“linkedin.com/in/merlinhalliday”). 

I am a Pharmacology graduate with a Masters in Neuroscience research. However, I am fascinated by all areas of science and technology. I first began to teach myself to code in Python, in the hopes of making the analysis of my research data easier. I have come a long way since then, adding JavaScript, HTML, CSS and SQL as well as numerous other libraries and frameworks to my ever-growing self-taught portfolio. There is still a lot I want to learn, so I invite anyone interested to follow along on here and on my [GitHub](“github.com/merlinhalliday”)
